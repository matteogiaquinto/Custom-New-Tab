# Custom New Tab

`Custom New Tab` is a free, local-first, minimalist new tab extension for Chromium browsers.

Instead of opening a blank page or a generic start-page extension, it shows a personal dashboard built around quick access, lightweight widgets, editable link collections, and local persistence.

## Why I Built It

I never found a new tab page that matched how I actually work.

Most alternatives felt:

- too generic
- too dependent on external services
- too visually noisy
- not flexible enough to separate work, university, and leisure

So I built my own: fast, compact, customizable, and fully client-side.

## Browser Compatibility

This extension is designed for Chromium-based browsers because it relies on the Chrome Extension API and a `chrome_url_overrides` new tab integration.

That means it should work in browsers such as:

- Chrome
- Brave
- Edge
- other Chromium-based browsers with support for unpacked Chrome extensions

It is not intended for Safari, and it is not currently presented as fully supported on Firefox.

## Privacy

- no database
- no backend
- no authentication
- no telemetry
- everything is stored locally in the browser

## Implementation Notes

- most of the application logic lives in [`custom-new-tab/app.js`](./custom-new-tab/app.js)
- legacy link data still remains compatible through `sections`
- `link-list` widgets still reference those sections via `config.sectionId`
- migration safety matters to avoid breaking existing installs
